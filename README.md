# LockMe: Secure File Encryption and Decryption - Website

LockMe is a Next.js based website for the LockMe desktop application, an offline-first tool for secure file encryption and decryption using AES-256 and RSA.

This project provides the landing page, blog, and informational content for LockMe.

## Features

- **Offline-First Security Focus**: The desktop application (promoted by this website) ensures your files and passwords never leave your computer.
- **Strong Encryption**: Utilizes AES-256 for file content and RSA for key management.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for simplicity with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Cross-Platform**: The LockMe desktop app is available for Windows and Linux.

## License

This website project and the LockMe desktop application are open source and released under the **MIT License**. We believe in transparency and community collaboration for building secure software.

## Getting Started with the Website Development

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) (or your configured port) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
